## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 and docx2txt to extract text from resumes
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes text (lowercasing, stopword removal)
3. **Matching Algorithm**:
   - TF-IDF vectorization of job description and resumes
   - Cosine similarity scoring
4. **Skills Analysis**:
   - Extracts skills from both job description and resumes
   - Compares to identify missing skills
5. **Results Display**:
   - Ranks candidates by match percentage
   - Highlights top 3 candidates
   - Shows missing skills for each candidate
